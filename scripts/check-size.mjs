// Bundle-size budget for @dalin/tactile.

// The library's whole pitch is "zero deps, tiny, lazily-loaded channels", so a
// size regression is a real defect. This measures the gzipped size of each
// published entry point (and its lazily-loaded chunks) and fails if any exceeds
// its budget. Pure Node, no dependencies — mirrors the package's own ethos.
//
// Budgets are deliberately generous headroom over today's sizes; tighten as the
// surface stabilizes. Run with `npm run size` (build first).
